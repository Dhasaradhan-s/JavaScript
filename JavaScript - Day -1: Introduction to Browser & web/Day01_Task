1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2



 HTTP/1.1
 
 
*The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997.
*Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1.
*This version is still in use on the web.
*3 TCP connection


 HTTP/2
 
 
*1 TCP Connection
* 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created
* HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate
* HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1

*One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
*HTTP/2 offers a feature called weighted prioritizationThis allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time

*In HTTP/2, when a client makes a request for a webpage, the server sends several streams of data to the client at once, instead of sending one thing after another. This method of data delivery is known as multiplexing.
*Developers can assign each of these data streams a different weighted value, and the value tells the client which data stream to render first.
* They can decide if the text of a webpage loads first, or the CSS files, or the JavaScript, or whatever they feel is most important for the user experience.



Multiplexing:

 HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource. HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.
 
Server push: 
 
 Typically, a server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it. However, this approach is not always practical for modern webpages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request. HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it.
 
Header compression: 

Small files load more quickly than large ones. To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets. This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet. Given the volume of HTTP packets involved in loading even a single webpage, those bytes add up quickly, resulting in faster loading. 
 
 
=> HTTP/3 runs over QUIC instead of TCP. QUIC is a faster and more secure transport layer protocol that is designed for the needs of the modern Internet.

=> Tcp - streams(data)  passing

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


objects are one of the fundamental data types and are used to store collections of key-value pairs. The internal representation of objects in JavaScript is based on a concept called "property maps."

When you create an object in JavaScript, it is essentially a container for properties. Each property has a name (referred to as a key or identifier) and a corresponding value. The value can be of any data type, including other objects or functions.

JavaScript engines use various techniques to optimize object representation and access. One common approach is the use of property maps, which are internal data structures associated with objects. Property maps store information about the object's properties and their locations in memory.


Object Creation:


let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};


function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Fiesta
console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santa Fe


var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “John”;
person.lastName = “Doe”;
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = “blue”;
